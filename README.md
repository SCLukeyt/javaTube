# javaTube

This is a discord bot that gives the first video in the list of videos from a search given by a command, and some statistics on the video

## Why?

This was a school project

##

Libraries Used:
 - Selenium (added 5/10/22 in push r0t1)
 - JDA api (added 5/19/22 in push r0t2)

##

Push logs:

> 5/10/22 - indevVersion r0t1
 - Created Project
 - Created system to take an input of text from a user and give the title of the first video in the search results on youtube for that text input

> 5/19/22 - indevVersion r0t2
 - Created class "scraper"
   - Searches for the input tect on youtube
   - gives back search results and details + link for the target video
 - Added preliminary code (currently commented) for discord integration
   - NOTE: We tried to do the discord stuff first, and it did not go well, please wish us luck in integration

##

NOTE:

Depending on decided functionality, bot may become private in order to not get taken down by youtube, and have the same fate as Groovy
